Weights were measured using a calibrated micro scale (Satorius CPA225D, Germany). Prices for steel cannula, mirror tiles, and wires were estimated without taking the cost of tools (e.g., glass cutter) into account. 3D printed parts were printed using a commercially available printer (Ultimaker 2+, the Netherlands) and PLA material (colorfabb, the Netherlands). Gray rows indicate alternative parts.
