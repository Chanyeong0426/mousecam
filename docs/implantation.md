# Implantation instructions

See paper for details on surgery. The counterpart of the miniature connector on the camera holder (e.g., Omnetics A79010-001 connector) can be fixed to the implant/microscope or directly onto the skull using strong dental cement (e.g., C&B Superbond, Sun Medical, Japan), so the camera holder can be easily and securely connected to the animal. The position and angle of the connector can be tested during surgery. However, it is possible to make finer adjustments later on by positioning the mirror (see [Calibration](calibration.md)). Therefore it is useful to be able to head-fix the mouse after it is fully recovered from surgery (e.g., in a recording set-up).
